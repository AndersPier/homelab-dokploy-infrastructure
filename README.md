## ⚠️ Important Clarifications

### **UCG Ultra "Load Balancing"**
The UCG Ultra provides **intelligent port forwarding with health checks**, not traditional load balancing. For true load balancing, this setup deploys an infrastructure Traefik instance that provides:
- Layer 7 load balancing
- Health checks and failover
- SSL termination
- Advanced routing rules

### **Network Requirements**
- **Simple Setup**: Any router with port forwarding (UCG Ultra recommended)
- **Enterprise Setup**: Managed switch required for VLAN functionality
- **Internet**: Static IP recommended but not required (dynamic DNS supported)

### **Hardware Scaling**
- **Minimum**: Single mini PC (16GB RAM, 500GB SSD)
- **Recommended**: Multiple servers for high availability
- **Storage**: QNAP NAS recommended, but any NFS server works

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Network Segmentation**: VLANs isolate different environments
- **SSL Everywhere**: Automatic HTTPS for all services
- **DNS Security**: AdGuard blocks malicious domains and ads
- **Access Control**: VPN-only access to management interfaces
- **Regular Updates**: Automated security patching
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypted backups to multiple locations

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerting

**Built-in Dashboards:**
- Infrastructure health and performance
- Application metrics and response times
- Network traffic and security events
- Storage usage and performance
- Certificate expiration tracking

**Alert Channels:**
